I believe in P2P technology and the decentralized systems it enables. More than just technology, these systems represent an alternative—a new "choice" for people.

### Introduction

Decentralized systems, epitomized by blockchain, function through a network of individual nodes, each communicating according to a specific set of rules—protocols. These protocols differ from one system to another. In fact, the protocol itself defines the community; it is the community. Within such a system, while there may be differences in computational power, there is no hierarchy of authority—every node is equal. Each node does nothing more than exchange information based on predefined rules, yet through countless interactions, an entire community emerges.

Nodes within this system participate voluntarily and autonomously. To join, one simply adheres to the protocol governing the system. No external force dictates behavior beyond the rules of the protocol itself. Furthermore, protocols are diverse, and participants have complete freedom: they can choose which protocol to engage with and how they wish to interact with it.

Unlike traditional web architectures that rely on a central server providing services to clients, this decentralized community operates differently. Here, every participant is both a provider and a user. No matter the implementation, this fundamental principle remains unchanged. Cultivating this mindset and environment is what truly matters.

### Decentralized Systems as a Choice

For those whose freedom is restricted, for those who are exploited—whether knowingly or unknowingly—for those whose privacy is infringed upon, decentralized systems offer an alternative. Simply by existing outside centralized control, they can provide immense value.

This is not to say that centralized structures are inherently evil. They offer many advantages, which is precisely why they have been widely adopted and have shaped our modern society. However, it is also true that centralized structures can deprive people and communities of their freedom.

The ability to choose is more valuable than we often realize—it should be a given. In a world without choice, people wouldn’t even recognize the concept of choice. That, to me, is a rather bleak reality. What matters most is awareness—the conscious recognition that one has made a choice, whether for a centralized or decentralized system.

Yes, there are still gaps in usability and convenience compared to existing systems. But if we believe in technology, these are temporary hurdles. With time and the collective efforts of researchers and developers, today’s inconveniences will be solved—perhaps even through decentralized systems themselves. If that is the case, then my role is to spread this idea and to help more people acquire the skills necessary to participate.

By "skills to participate," I refer—among other things—to the ability to engage with decentralized systems through computing. Computers are tools that extend human capabilities, and within decentralized networks, they enable individuals to join and contribute to new communities.

### Conclusion

At Centrum, we aim to gather skilled individuals to collectively operate decentralized system nodes. Any and all decentralized protocols should be welcome here. While blockchain is the most prominent example, we also embrace other P2P-based systems such as Tor and IPFS. We welcome anyone who seeks to engage with communities built upon decentralized protocols.

These nodes will primarily run on physical servers. While certain high-spec requirements may pose challenges, most systems can operate on mini-PCs, which we will utilize at Centrum.

Establishing this environment will facilitate onboarding new participants and engaging the broader public. Whether setting up new nodes, visualizing network activity, or hosting workshops, the direction this initiative takes will be shaped by the community. The potential for expanding the decentralized world is vast. Given that Centrum is both a physical space and an event hub, it naturally attracts attention and fosters involvement—making it the ideal place for this endeavor.

We are committed to taking the first step, building a community, and driving the adoption of decentralized systems.
